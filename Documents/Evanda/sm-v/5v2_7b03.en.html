<P></P>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The V5 variable displacement compressor along with the thermal expansion valve on the evaporator, constitutes a largely self-regulating system. There is no pressure cycling switch, no high-pressure cut-off switch and no low-pressure cut-off switch. The compressor clutch is controlled by the electronic control module (ECM), which receives data from various engine systems and from a pressure transducer located in the high-pressure refrigerant pipe. In normal operation, the clutch is engaged continuously. Should one of the monitored conditions become abnormal, the ECM will disengage the compressor clutch until normal operation is restored. These conditions include the following:</div>
				<UL>
<Li>Wide-open throttle.</Li>
					<Li>High engine coolant temperature.</Li>
					<Li>High engine RPM.</Li>
					<Li>Refrigerant low pressure.</Li>
					<Li>Refrigerant high pressure.</Li>
				</UL>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The compressor clutch will remain disengaged until normal operation is established.</div>

<DIV align="left" id="V7B0SCF"><font size="4"><b>System Components-Functional </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V7B0COMP"><font size="4"><b>Compressor</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
				<div class="T1" align="left">All compressors are belt-driven from the engine crankshaft through the compressor clutch pulley. The compressor pulley rotates without driving the compressor shaft until an electromagnetic clutch coil is energized. When voltage is applied to energize the clutch coil, the clutch plate and hub assembly is drawn rearward toward the pulley. The magnetic force locks the clutch plate and pulley together as one unit to drive the compressor shaft.</div>
					<div class="T1" align="left">As the compressor shaft is driven, it compresses the low-pressure refrigerant vapor from the evaporator into a high-pressure, high-temperature vapor. The refrigerant oil which is used to lubricate the compressor is carried with the refrigerant. Refer to   <A target="_blank" href="5V2_7B02.en.html#V7B0VACCO">"V5 Air Conditioning Compressor Overhaul" </A>
in this section.</div>
				
			
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V7B0PRV"><font size="4"><b>Pressure Relief Valve</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The compressor is equipped with a pressure relief valve which is placed in the system as a safety factor. Under certain conditions, the refrigerant on the discharge side may exceed the designed operating pressure. In order to prevent system damage, the valve is designed to open automatically at approximately 3 171 to 4 137 kPa (460 to 600 psi) in an R-134a system. Conditions that might cause this valve to open, such as a defective pressure transducer, an inoperative cooling fan, etc., should be corrected. The refrigerant oil and the refrigerant should be replaced as necessary.</div>
				
			
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V7B0CC"><font size="4"><b>Condenser Core</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The condenser assembly in front of the radiator consists of coils which carry the refrigerant, and cooling fins that  provide the rapid transfer of heat. The air passing through the condenser cools the high-pressure refrigerant vapor and causes it to condense into a liquid.</div>
				
			
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V7B0EV"><font size="4"><b>Expansion Valve</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The expansion valve is located with the evaporator core, inside the heater/air distributor case under the instrument panel.</div>
					<div class="T1" align="left">The expansion valve can fail in three different positions: open, closed, or restricted.</div>
					<div class="T1" align="left">An expansion valve that fails in the open position will result in a noisy A/C compressor or no cooling. The cause can be a broken spring, a broken ball, or excessive moisture in the A/C system. If the spring or the ball are found to be defective, replace the expansion valve. If excessive moisture is found in the A/C system, recycle the refrigerant.</div>
					<div class="T1" align="left">An expansion valve that fails in the closed position will result in low suction pressure and no cooling. This may be caused by a failed power dome or excessive moisture in the A/C system. If the power dome on the expansion valve is found to be defective, replace the expansion valve. If excessive moisture is found in the A/C system, recycle the refrigerant.</div>
					<div class="T1" align="left">A restricted expansion valve will result in low suction pressure and no cooling. This may be caused by debris in the refrigerant system. If debris is believed to be the cause, recycle the refrigerant, replace the expansion valve, and replace the receiver-dryer.</div>
				
			
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V7B0EC1"><font size="4"><b>Evaporator Core</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The evaporator is a device which cools and dehumidifies the air before it enters the vehicle. High-pressure liquid refrigerant flows through the expansion tube orifice and becomes a low-pressure gas in the evaporator. The heat in the air passing through the evaporator core is transferred to the cooler surface of the core, which cools the air. As the process of heat transfer from the air to the evaporator core surface is taking place, any moisture or humidity in the air condenses on the outside surface of the evaporator core and is drained off as water.</div>
				
			
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V7B0RD1"><font size="4"><b>Receiver-Dryer</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The sealed receiver-dryer assembly is connected to the condenser outlet pipe. It acts as a refrigerant storing container, receiving liquid, vapor, and refrigerant oil from the evaporator.</div>
					<div class="T1" align="left">At the bottom of the receiver-dryer is the desiccant, which acts as a drying agent for the moisture that may have entered the system. An oil bleed hole is located near the bottom of the receiver-dryer outlet pipe to provide an oil return path to the compressor. The receiver-dryer is serviceable only as an assembly.</div>
				
			
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V7B0HC1"><font size="4"><b>Heater Core</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The heater core heats the air before it enters the vehicle. Engine coolant is circulated through the core to heat the outside air passing over the fins of the core. The core is functional at all times and may be used to temper conditioned air in the A/C mode as well as in the heat or the vent modes.</div>

<P></P>
			<div class="T1" align="left">Vehicles using the V5 compressor may have differences between installations in the mounting brackets, the drive systems, the pulleys, the connections, and the system capacities. Basic overhaul procedures are similar between the compressors used on different vehicles.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">When servicing the compressor, keep dirt and foreign material from getting on or into the compressor parts and the system. Clean tools and a clean work area are important for proper service. The compressor connections and the outside of the compressor should be cleaned before undertaking any on-vehicle repairs and before the removal of the compressor. The parts must be kept clean at all times. Any parts that are to be reassembled should be cleaned with trichloroethane, naphtha, stoddard solvent, kerosene, or equivalent solvents and dried with dry air. Use only lint-free cloths to wipe the parts.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The operations described are based on bench overhaul with the compressor removed from the vehicle, except as noted. They have been prepared in the order of accessibility of the components. When a compressor is removed from the vehicle for servicing, the amount of oil remaining in the compressor should be drained, measured, and recorded. This oil should then be discarded and new polyalkaline glycol (PAG) refrigerant oil added to the compressor.</div>

<DIV align="left" id="V7B0VCDO1"><font size="4"><b>V5 Compressor-Description of Operation </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The V5 is a variable displacement compressor that can match the automotive A/C demand under all conditions without cycling. The basic compressor mechanism is a variable angle wobble-plate with five axially oriented cylinders. The center of control of the compressor displacement is a billows-actuated control valve located in the rear head of the compressor that senses compressor suction pressure.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The wobble-plate angle and the compressor displacement are controlled by the crankcase suction pressure differential. When the A/C capacity demand is high, the suction pressure will be above the control point. The valve will maintain a bleed from crankcase to suction. With no crankcase-suction pressure differential, the compressor will have maximum displacement.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">When the A/C capacity demand is lower and the suction pressure reaches the control point, the valve will bleed discharge gas into the crankcase and close off a passage from the crankcase to the suction plenum. The angle of the wobble-plate is controlled by a force balance on the five pistons. A slight elevation of the crankcase suction pressure differential creates total force on the pistons resulting in a movement about the wobble-plate pivot pin that reduces the plate angle.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The compressor has a unique lubrication system. The crankcase suction bleed is routed through the rotating wobble-plate for lubrication of the wobble-plate bearing. The rotation acts as an oil separator which removes some of the oil from the crankcase suction bleed, re-routing it to the crankcase where it can lubricate the compressor mechanism.</div>
