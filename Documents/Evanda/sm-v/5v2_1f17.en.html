<DIV align="left" id="V1F0ISO"><font size="4"><b>Ignition System Operation </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">This ignition system does not use a conventional distributor
and coil. It uses a crankshaft position sensor input
to the engine control module (ECM). The ECM then determines
Electronic Spark Timing (EST) and triggers the
direct ignition system ignition coil.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">This type of distributorless ignition system uses a
"waste spark" method of spark distribution. Each cylinder
is paired with the cylinder that is opposite it (1-4
or 2-3). The spark occurs simultaneously in the cylinder
coming up on the compression stroke and in the cylinder
coming up on the exhaust stroke. The cylinder on the
exhaust stroke requires very little of the available energy
to fire the spark plug. The remaining energy is available
to the spark plug in the cylinder on the compression
stroke.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">These systems use the EST signal from the ECM to
control the electronic spark timing. The ECM uses the
following information:</div>
			<UL>
				<Li>Engine load (manifold pressure or vacuum).</Li>
				<Li>Atmospheric (barometric) pressure.</Li>
				<Li>Engine temperature.</Li>
				<Li>Intake air temperature.</Li>
				<Li>Crankshaft position.</Li>
				<Li>Engine speed (rpm).</Li>

<DIV align="left" id="V1F0EISIC1"><font size="4"><b>Electronic Ignition System Ignition Coil
 </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The Electronic Ignition (EI) system ignition coil provides the spark for two spark plugs simultaneously. The EI system ignition coil is not serviceable and must be replaced as an assembly.</div>
		
	
	
		<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0CPS2"><font size="4"><b>Crankshaft Position Sensor </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">This direct ignition system uses a magnetic crankshaft
position sensor. This sensor protrudes through its mount
to within approximately 0.05 inch (1.3 mm) of the crankshaft
reluctor. The reluctor is a special wheel attached to
the crankshaft or crankshaft pulley with 58 slots machined
into it, 57 of which are equally spaced in 6 degree
intervals. The last slot is wider and serves to generate a
"sync pulse." As the crankshaft rotates, the slots in the
reluctor change the magnetic field of the sensor, creating
an induced voltage pulse. The longer pulse of the
58th slot identifies a specific orientation of the crankshaft
and allows the engine control module (ECM) to determine
the crankshaft orientation at all times. The ECM
uses this information to generate timed ignition and injection
pulses that it sends to the ignition coils and to the
fuel injectors.</div>
		
	
	
		<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0CPS3"><font size="4"><b>Camshaft Position Sensor </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The Camshaft Position (CMP) sensor sends a CMP
sensor signal to the engine control module (ECM). The
ECM uses this signal as a "sync pulse" to trigger the injectors
in the proper sequence. The ECM uses the CMP
sensor signal to indicate the position of the #1 piston
during its power stroke. This allows the ECM to calculate
true sequential fuel injection mode of operation. If the
ECM detects an incorrect CMP sensor signal while the
engine is running, DTC P0341 will set. If the CMP sensor
signal is lost while the engine is running, the fuel injection
system will shift to a calculated sequential fuel
injection mode based on the last fuel injection pulse, and
the engine will continue to run. As long as the fault is
present, the engine can be restarted. It will run in the calculated
sequential mode with a 1-in-6 chance of the injector
sequence being correct.</div>

<DIV align="left" id="V1F0IASO"><font size="4"><b>Idle Air System Operation </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The idle air system operation is controlled by the base idle setting of the throttle body and the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The engine control module (ECM) uses the IAC valve to
set the idle speed dependent on conditions. The ECM
uses information from various inputs, such as coolant
temperature, manifold vacuum, etc., for the effective
control of the idle speed.</div>
		
	
	
		<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0FCSO"><font size="4"><b>Fuel Control System Operation
 </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The function of the fuel metering system is to deliver the correct amount of fuel to the engine under all operating conditions. The fuel is delivered to the engine by the  individual fuel injectors mounted into the intake manifold near each cylinder.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The two main fuel control sensors are the Manifold Absolute
Pressure (MAP) sensor, the Front Heated Oxygen Sensor (HO2S1) and the Rear Heated Oxygen Sensor (HO2S2).</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The MAP sensor measures or senses the intake manifold
vacuum. Under high fuel demands the MAP sensor
reads a low vacuum condition, such as wide open
throttle. The engine control module (ECM) uses this information
to richen the mixture, thus increasing the fuel
injector on-time, to provide the correct amount of fuel.
When decelerating, the vacuum increases. This vacuum
change is sensed by the MAP sensor and read by the
ECM, which then decreases the fuel injector on-time
due to the low fuel demand conditions.</div>
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0OS"><b>HO2S Sensors</b></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">The HO2S sensor is located in the exhaust manifold. The
HO2S sensor indicates to the ECM the amount of oxygen
in the exhaust gas and the ECM changes the air/fuel ratio
to the engine by controlling the fuel injectors. The
best air/fuel ratio to minimize exhaust emissions is 14.7 to 1, which allows the catalytic converter to operate
most efficiently. Because of the constant measuring and
adjusting of the air/fuel ratio, the fuel injection system
is called a "closed loop" system.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The ECM uses voltage inputs from several sensors to
determine how much fuel to provide to the engine. The
fuel is delivered under one of several conditions, called
"modes."</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0SM"><b>Starting Mode</b></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">When the ignition is turned ON, the ECM turns the fuel
pump relay on for two seconds. The fuel pump then
builds fuel pressure. The ECM also checks the Engine
Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor and the Throttle
Position (TP) sensor and determines the proper air/fuel
ratio for starting the engine. This ranges from 1.5 to 1 at
-97 °F (-36 °C) coolant temperature to 14.7 to 1 at
201 °F (94 °C) coolant temperature. The ECM controls
the amount of fuel delivered in the starting mode by
changing how long the fuel injector is turned on and off.
This is done by "pulsing" the fuel injectors for very short
times.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0CFM"><b>Clear Flood Mode</b></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">If the engine floods with excessive fuel, it may be
cleared by pushing the accelerator pedal down all the
way. The ECM will then completely turn off the fuel by
eliminating any fuel injector signal. The ECM holds this
injector rate as long as the throttle stays wide open and
the engine is below approximately 400. If the throttle
position becomes less than approximately 80 percent,
the ECM returns to the starting mode.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0RM"><b>Run Mode</b></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">The run mode has two conditions called "open loop" and "closed loop."</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0OL"><b>Open Loop</b></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">When the engine is first started and it is above 400 rpm,
the system goes into "open loop" operation. In "open
loop," the ECM ignores the signal from the HO2S and calculates
the air/fuel ratio based on inputs from the ECT
sensor and the MAP sensor. The sensor stays in "open
loop" until the following conditions are met:</div>
				<UL>
					<Li>The HO2S sensor has a varying voltage output, showing that it is hot enough to operate properly.</Li>
					<Li>The ECT sensor is above a specified temperature.</Li>
					<Li>A specific amount of time has elapsed after starting the engine.</Li>
				</UL>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0CL"><b>Closed Loop</b></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">The specific values for the above conditions vary with
different engines and are stored in the Electronically
Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM).
When these conditions are met, the system
goes into "closed loop" operation. In "closed loop," the
ECM calculates the air/fuel ratio (fuel injector on-time)
based on the signal from the oxygen sensor. This allows
the air/fuel ratio to stay very close to 14.7 to 1.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0AM"><b>Acceleration Mode</b></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">The ECM responds to rapid changes in throttle position
and airflow and provides extra fuel.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0DM"><b>Deceleration Mode</b></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">The ECM responds to changes in throttle position and
airflow and reduces the amount of fuel. When deceleration
is very fast, the ECM can cut off fuel completely for
short periods of time.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0BVCM"><b>Battery Voltage Correction Mode</b></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">When battery voltage is low, the ECM can compensate
for a weak spark delivered by the ignition module by using
the following methods:</div>
				<UL>
					<Li>Increasing the fuel injector pulse width.</Li>
					<Li>Increasing the idle speed rpm.</Li>
					<Li>Increasing the ignition dwell time.</Li>
				</UL>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0FCM"><b>Fuel Cut-Off Mode</b></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">No fuel is delivered by the fuel injectors when the ignition is OFF. This prevents dieseling or engine run-on. Also, the fuel is not delivered if there are no reference pulses received from the central power supply. This prevents flooding.</div>

<DIV align="left" id="V1F0EECSO"><font size="4"><b>Evaporative Emission Control System Operation </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The basic Evaporative (EVAP) Emission control system used is the charcoal canister storage method. This method transfers fuel vapor from the fuel tank to an activated carbon (charcoal) storage device (canister) to hold the vapors when the vehicle is not operating. When the engine is running, the fuel vapor is purged from the carbon element by intake airflow and consumed in the normal combustion process.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">Gasoline vapors from the fuel tank flow into the tube labeled
TANK. These vapors are absorbed into the carbon.
The canister is purged by the engine control
module (ECM) when the engine has been running for a
specified amount of time. Air is drawn into the canister
and mixed with the vapor. This mixture is then drawn
into the intake manifold.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The ECM supplies a ground to energize the EVAP emission
canister purge solenoid valve. This valve is Pulse
Width Modulated (PWM) or turned on and off several
times a second. The EVAP emission canister purge
PWM duty cycle varies according to operating conditions
determined by mass airflow, fuel trim, and intake
air temperature.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">Poor idle, stalling, and poor driveability can be caused by the following conditions:</div>
			<UL>
				<Li>An inoperative EVAP emission canister purge solenoid valve.</Li>
				<Li>A damaged canister.</Li>
				<Li>Hoses that are split, cracked, or not connected to the proper tubes.</Li>

<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The Evaporative (EVAP) Emission canister is an emission control device containing activated charcoal granules. The EVAP emission canister is used to store fuel vapors from the fuel tank.

<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">A Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) system is used to provide complete use of the crankcase vapors. Fresh air from the air cleaner is supplied to the crankcase. The fresh air is mixed with blowby gases which are then passed through a vacuum hose into the intake manifold.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">Periodically inspect the hoses and the clamps. Replace any crankcase ventilation components as required.</div>

<DIV align="left" id="V1F0ECTS1"><font size="4"><b>Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor
 </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor is a
thermistor (a resistor which changes value based on
temperature) mounted in the engine coolant stream.
Low coolant temperature produces a high resistance
(100,000 ohms at -40 °F [-40 °C]) while high temperature
causes low resistance (70 ohms at 266 °F [130 °C]).</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The engine control module (ECM) supplies 5 volts to the
ECT sensor through a resistor in the ECM and measures
the change in voltage. The voltage will be high
when the engine is cold, and low when the engine is hot.
By measuring the change in voltage, the ECM can determine
the coolant temperature. The engine coolant
temperature affects most of the systems that the ECM
controls. A failure in the ECT sensor circuit should set a
diagnostic trouble code P0117 or P0118. Remember,
these diagnostic trouble codes indicate a failure in the
ECT sensor circuit, so proper use of the chart will lead
either to repairing a wiring problem or to replacing the
sensor to repair a problem properly.</div>
		
	
	
		<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0TPS1"><font size="4"><b>Throttle Position Sensor
 </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The Throttle Position (TP) sensor is a potentiometer
connected to the throttle shaft of the throttle body. The
TP sensor electrical circuit consists of a 5 volt supply
line and a ground line, both provided by the engine control
module (ECM). The ECM calculates the throttle
position by monitoring the voltage on this signal line. The
TP sensor output changes as the accelerator pedal is
moved, changing the throttle valve angle. At a closed
throttle position, the output of the TP sensor is low,
about 0.5 volt. As the throttle valve opens, the output increases
so that, at Wide Open Throttle (WOT), the output
voltage will be about 5 volts.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The ECM can determine fuel delivery based on throttle
valve angle (driver demand). A broken or loose TP sensor
can cause intermittent bursts of fuel from the injector
and an unstable idle, because the ECM thinks the
throttle is moving. A problem in any of the TP sensor circuits
should set a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) P0121
or P0122. Once the DTC is set, the ECM will substitute a
default value for the TP sensor and some vehicle performance
will return. A DTC P0121 will cause a high idle
speed.</div>

<DIV align="left" id="V1F0CMOS"><font size="4"><b>Catalyst  Monitor Oxygen Sensors
 </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">Three-way catalytic converters are used to control emissions
of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO),
and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The catalyst within the
converters promotes a chemical reaction. This reaction
oxidizes the HC and CO present in the exhaust gas and
converts them into harmless water vapor and carbon
dioxide. The catalyst also reduces NOx by converting it
to nitrogen. The engine control module (ECM) can monitor
this process using the HO2S1 and HO2S2 sensor.
These sensors produce an output signal which indicates
the amount of oxygen present in the exhaust gas entering
and leaving the three-way converter. This indicates
the catalyst's ability to efficiently convert exhaust
gasses. If the catalyst is operating efficiently, the
HO2S1 sensor signals will be more active than the signals
produced by the HO2S2 sensor. The catalyst monitor
sensors operate the same way as the fuel control sensors.
The sensor’s main function is catalyst monitoring,
but they also have a limited role in fuel control. If a sensor
output indicates a voltage either above or below the
450 mv bias voltage for an extended period of time, the
ECM will make a slight adjustment to fuel trim to ensure
that fuel delivery is correct for catalyst monitoring.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">A problem with the HO2S1 sensor circuit will set DTC
P0131, P0132, P0133 or P0134 depending, on the special
condition. A problem with the HO2S2 sensor signal
will set DTC P0137, P0138, P0140 or P0141, depending
on the special condition.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">A fault in the Rear Heated Oxygen Sensor (HO2S2) heater element
or its ignition feed or ground will result in lower oxygen
sensor response. This may cause incorrect catalyst
monitor diagnostic results.</div>

<DIV align="left" id="V1F0EGRV1"><font size="4"><b>Exhaust Gas Recirculation Valve
 </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system is used
on engines equipped with an automatic transaxle to lower
NOx (oxides of nitrogen) emission levels caused by
high combustion temperature. The EGR valve is controlled
by the engine control module (ECM). The EGR
valve feeds small amounts of exhaust gas into the intake
manifold to decrease combustion temperature. The
amount of exhaust gas recirculated is controlled by variations
in vacuum and exhaust back pressure. If too
much exhaust gas enters, combustion will not take
place. For this reason, very little exhaust gas is allowed
to pass through the valve, especially at idle.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The EGR valve is usually open under the following conditions:</div>

<P></P>
			
			<div class="T1" align="left">The IAC valve is mounted on the throttle body where it
controls the engine idle speed under the command of
the engine control module (ECM). The ECM sends voltage
pulses to the IAC valve motor windings, causing the
IAC valve pintle to move in or out a given distance (a
step or count) for each pulse. The pintle movement controls
the airflow around the throttle valves which, in turn,
control the engine idle speed.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The desired idle speeds for all engine operating conditions
are programmed into the calibration of the ECM.
These programmed engine speeds are based on the
coolant temperature, the park/neutral position switch
status, the vehicle speed, the battery voltage, and the
A/C system pressure (if equipped).</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The ECM "learns" the proper IAC valve positions to
achieve warm, stabilized idle speeds (rpm) desired for
the various conditions (park/neutral or drive, A/C on or
off, if equipped). This information is stored in ECM "keep
alive" memories. Information is retained after the ignition
is turned OFF. All other IAC valve positioning is calculated
based on these memory values. As a result, engine
variations due to wear and variations in the
minimum throttle valve position (within limits) do not affect
engine idle speeds. This system provides correct
idle control under all conditions. This also means that
disconnecting power to the ECM can result in incorrect
idle control or the necessity to partially press the accelerator
when starting until the ECM relearns idle control.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">Engine idle speed is a function of total airflow into the
engine based on the IAC valve pintle position, the
throttle valve opening, and the calibrated vacuum loss
through accessories. The minimum throttle valve position
is set at the factory with a stop screw. This setting
allows enough airflow by the throttle valve to cause the
IAC valve pintle to be positioned a calibrated number of
steps (counts) from the seat during "controlled" idle operation.
The minimum throttle valve position setting on
this engine should not be considered the "minimum idle
speed," as on other fuel injected engines. The throttle
stop screw is covered with a plug at the factory following
adjustment.</div>

the engine control module (ECM) will read the manifold
pressure as barometric pressure and adjust the air/fuel
ratio accordingly. This compensation for altitude allows
the system to maintain driving performance while holding
emissions low. The barometric function will update
periodically during steady driving or under a wide open
throttle condition. In the case of a fault in the barometric
portion of the MAP sensor, the ECM will set to the default
value.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">A failure in the MAP sensor circuit sets a diagnostic trouble code P0107 or P0108.</div>

<DIV align="left" id="V1F0ECM1"><font size="4"><b>Engine Control Module
 </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The engine control module (ECM), located inside the
passenger kick-panel, is the control center of the fuel injection
system. It constantly looks at the information
from various sensors and controls the systems that affect
the vehicle’s performance. The ECM also performs
the diagnostic functions of the system. It can recognize
operational problems, alert the driver through the Malfunction
Indicator Lamp (MIL), and store diagnostic
trouble code(s) which identify problem areas to aid the
technician in making repairs.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">There are no serviceable parts in the ECM. The calibrations
are stored in the ECM in the Programmable Read-
Only Memory (PROM).</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The ECM supplies either 5 or 12 volts to power the sensors
or switches. This is done through resistances in the
ECM which are so high in value that a test light will not
come on when connected to the circuit. In some cases,
even an ordinary shop voltmeter will not give an accurate
reading because its resistance is too low. You must use a digital voltmeter with a 10 megohm input impedance
to get accurate voltage readings. The ECM controls
output circuits such as the fuel injectors, the idle air
control valve, the A/C clutch relay, etc., by controlling
the ground circuit through transistors or a device called
a "quad-driver."</div>
		
	
	
		<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0FI"><font size="4"><b>Fuel Injector
 </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The Multiport Fuel Injection (MFI) assembly is a solenoid-
operated device controlled by the engine control
module (ECM). It meters pressurized fuel to a single engine
cylinder. The ECM energizes the fuel injector or the
solenoid to a normally closed ball or pintle valve. This allows
fuel to flow into the top of the injector, past the
ball or pintle valve, and through a recessed flow director
plate at the injector outlet.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The director plate has six machined holes that control
the fuel flow, generating a conical spray pattern of finely
atomized fuel at the injector tip. Fuel from the tip is directed
at the intake valve, causing it to become further atomized and vaporized before entering the combustion
chamber. A fuel injector which is stuck partially open will
cause a loss of fuel pressure after the engine is shut
down. Also, an extended crank time will be noticed on
some engines. Dieseling can also occur because some
fuel can be delivered to the engine after the ignition is
turned OFF.</div>

<DIV align="left" id="V1F0KS1"><font size="4"><b>Knock Sensor

 </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The knock sensor detects abnormal knocking in the engine.
The sensor is mounted in the engine block near the
cylinders. The sensor produces an AC output voltage
which increases with the severity of the knock. This signal
is sent to the engine control module (ECM). The
ECM then adjusts the ignition timing to reduce the spark
knock.</div>

<DIV align="left" id="V1F0GS1"><font size="4"><b>G Sensor </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">The engine control module (ECM) receives rough road
information from the G sensor. The ECM uses the rough
road information to enable or disable the misfire diagnostic.
The misfire diagnostic can be greatly affected by
crankshaft speed variations caused by driving on rough
road surfaces. The G sensor generates rough road information
by producing a signal which is proportional to
the movement of a small metal bar inside the sensor.</div>
			<div class="T1" align="left">If a fault occurs which causes the ECM to not receive
rough road information between 30 and 80 mph (50 and
132 km/h), DTC P1391 will set.</div>

<P></P>
		
			<div class="T1" align="left">Based on the knowledge gained from On-Board Diagnostic (EOBD) experience in the 1994 and 1995 model years, this list of non-vehicle faults that could affect the performance of the EOBD system has been compiled. These non-vehicle faults vary from environmental conditions to the quality of fuel used. With the introduction of EOBD diagnostics across the entire passenger car and light-duty truck market in 1996, illumination of the MIL due to a non-vehicle fault could lead to misdiagnosis of the vehicle, increased warranty expense and customer dissatisfaction. The following list of non-vehicle faults does not include every possible fault and may not apply equally to all product lines.</div>
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0FQ"><font size="4"><b>Fuel Quality</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">Fuel quality is not a new issue for the automotive industry, but its potential for turning on the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) with EOBD systems is new.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">Fuel additives such as "dry gas" and "octane enhancers" may affect the performance of the fuel. If this results in an incomplete combustion or a partial burn, it will set DTC P0300. The Reed Vapor Pressure of the fuel can also create problems in the fuel system, especially during the spring and fall months when severe ambient temperature swings occur. A high Reed Vapor Pressure could show up as a Fuel Trim DTC due to excessive canister loading. High vapor pressures generated in the fuel tank can also affect the Evaporative Emission diagnostic as well.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">Using fuel with the wrong octane rating for your vehicle may cause driveability problems. Many of the major fuel companies advertise that using "premium" gasoline will improve the performance of your vehicle. Most premium fuels use alcohol to increase the octane rating of the fuel. Although alcohol-enhanced fuels may raise the octane rating, the fuel's ability to turn into vapor in cold temperatures deteriorates. This may affect the starting ability and cold driveability of the engine.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">Low fuel levels can lead to fuel starvation, lean engine operation, and eventually engine misfire.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0NP"><font size="4"><b>Non-OEM Parts</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">All of the EOBD diagnostics have been calibrated to run with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts. Something as simple as a high-performance exhaust system that affects exhaust system back pressure could potentially interfere with the operation of the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve and thereby turn on the MIL. Small leaks in the exhaust system near the post catalyst oxygen sensor can also cause the MIL to turn on.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">Aftermarket electronics, such as cellular phones, stereos, and anti-theft devices, may radiate electromagnetic interference (EMI) into the control system if they are improperly installed. This may cause a false sensor reading and turn on the MIL.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0ENVIR"><font size="4"><b>Environment</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">Temporary environmental conditions, such as localized flooding, will have an effect on the vehicle ignition system. If the ignition system is rain-soaked, it can temporarily cause engine misfire and turn on the MIL.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0REFUE"><font size="4"><b>Refueling</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">A new EOBD diagnostic checks the integrity of the entire Evaporative (EVAP) Emission system. If the vehicle is restarted after refueling and the fuel cap is not secured correctly, the on-board diagnostic system will sense this as a system fault, turn on the MIL, and set DTC P0440.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0VM"><font size="4"><b>Vehicle Marshaling</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">The transportation of new vehicles from the assembly plant to the dealership can involve as many as 60 key cycles within 2 to 3 miles of driving. This type of operation contributes to the fuel fouling of the spark plugs and will turn on the MIL with a set DTC P0300.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0PVM"><font size="4"><b>Poor Vehicle Maintenance</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">The sensitivity of EOBD diagnostics will cause the MIL to turn on if the vehicle is not maintained properly. Restricted air filters, fuel filters, and crankcase deposits due to lack of oil changes or improper oil viscosity can trigger actual vehicle faults that were not previously monitored prior to EOBD. Poor vehicle maintenance can not be classified as a "non-vehicle fault," but with the sensitivity of EOBD diagnostics, vehicle maintenance schedules must be more closely followed.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0SV"><font size="4"><b>Severe Vibration</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">The Misfire diagnostic measures small changes in the rotational speed of the crankshaft. Severe driveline vibrations in the vehicle, such as caused by an excessive amount of mud on the wheels, can have the same effect on crankshaft speed as misfire and, therefore, may set DTC P0300.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="V1F0RSF"><font size="4"><b>Related System Faults</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">Many of the EOBD system diagnostics will not run if the engine control module (ECM) detects a fault on a related system or component. One example would be that if the ECM detected a Misfire fault, the diagnostics on the catalytic converter would be suspended until the Misfire fault was repaired. If the Misfire fault is severe enough, the catalytic converter can be damaged due to overheating and will never set a Catalyst DTC until the Misfire fault is repaired and the Catalyst diagnostic is allowed to run to completion. If this happens, the customer may have to make two trips to the dealership in order to repair the vehicle.</div>

				<div class="T1" align="left">Technically, a trip is a key-on run key-off cycle in which all the enable criteria for a given diagnostic are met, allowing the diagnostic to run. Unfortunately, this concept is not quite that simple. A trip is official when all the enable criteria for a given diagnostic are met. But because the enable criteria vary from one diagnostic to another, the definition of trip varies as well. Some diagnostics are run when the vehicle is at operating temperature, some when the vehicle first starts up; some require that the vehicle be cruising at a steady highway speed, some run only when the vehicle is at idle; some diagnostics function with the Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) disabled. Some run only immediately following a cold engine startup.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">A trip then, is defined as a key-on run key-off cycle in which the vehicle was operated in such a way as to satisfy the enables criteria for a given diagnostic, and this diagnostic will consider this cycle to be one trip.

The engine control module (ECM) determines crankshaft rotational velocity using the Crankshaft Position (CKP) sensor and the Camshaft Position (CMP) sensor. When a cylinder misfires, the crankshaft slows down momentarily. By monitoring the CKP and CMP sensor signals, the ECM can calculate when a misfire occurs.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">For a non-catalyst damaging misfire, the diagnostic will be required to monitor a misfire present for between 1000-3200 engine revolutions.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">For catalyst-damaging misfire, the diagnostic will respond to misfire within 200 engine revolutions.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">Rough roads may cause false misfire detection. A rough road will cause torque to be applied to the drive wheels and drive train. This torque can intermittently decrease the crankshaft rotational velocity. This may be falsely detected as a misfire.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">A rough road sensor, or G sensor, works together with the misfire detection system. The G sensor produces a voltage that varies along with the intensity of road vibrations. When the ECM detects a rough road, the misfire detection system is temporarily disabled.</div>

<DIV align="left" id="V1F0MC"><font size="4"><b>Misfire Counters</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">Whenever a cylinder misfires, the misfire diagnostic counts the misfire and notes the crankshaft position at the time the misfire occurred. These "misfire counters" are basically a file on each engine cylinder. A current and a history misfire counter are maintained for each cylinder. The misfire current counters (Misfire Cur #1-4) indicate the number of firing events out of the last 200 cylinder firing events which were misfires. The misfire current counter will display real time data without a misfire Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) stored. The misfire history counters (Misfire Hist #1-4) indicate the total number of cylinder firing events which were misfires. The misfire history counters will display 0 until the misfire diagnostic has failed and a DTC P0300 is set. Once the misfire DTC P0300 is set, the misfire history counters will be updated  every 200 cylinder firing events. A misfire counter is maintained for each cylinder.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">If the misfire diagnostic reports a failure, the diagnostic executive reviews all of the misfire counters before reporting a DTC. This way, the diagnostic executive reports the most current information.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">When crankshaft rotation is erratic, a misfire condition will be detected. Because of this erratic condition, the data that is collected by the diagnostic can sometimes incorrectly identify which cylinder is misfiring.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">Use diagnostic equipment to monitor misfire counter data on On-Board Diagnostic (EOBD) compliant vehicles. Knowing which specific cylinder(s) misfired can lead to the root cause, even when dealing with a multiple cylinder misfire. Using the information in the misfire counters, identify which cylinders are misfiring. If the counters indicate cylinders numbers 1 and 4 misfired, look for a circuit or component common to both cylinders number 1 and 4.</div>

caused by excessive fuel vapor from the Evaporative
(EVAP) Emission canister. In order to meet EOBD requirements,
the control module uses weighted fuel trim
cells to determine the need to set a fuel trim DTC. A fuel
trim DTC can only be set if fuel trim counts in the
weighted fuel trim cells exceed specifications. This
means that the vehicle could have a fuel trim problem
which is causing a problem under certain conditions
(i.e., engine idle high due to a small vacuum leak or
rough idle due to a large vacuum leak) while it operates
fine at other times. No fuel trim DTC would set (although
an engine idle speed DTC or HO2S2 DTC may set). Use a
scan tool to observe fuel trim counts while the problem is
occurring.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">A fuel trim DTC may be triggered by a number of vehicle faults. Make use of all information available (other DTCs stored, rich or lean condition, etc.) when diagnosing a fuel trim fault.</div>

				<div class="T1" align="left">No fuel trim DTC will set regardless of the fuel trim counts in cell 0 unless the fuel trim counts in the weighted cells are also outside specifications. This means that the vehicle could have a fuel trim problem which is causing a problem under certain conditions (i.e. engine idle high due to a small vacuum leak or rough due to a large vacuum leak) while it operates fine at other times. No fuel trim DTC would set (although an engine idle speed DTC or HO2S2 DTC may set). Use a scan tool to observe fuel trim counts while the problem is occurring.</div>
