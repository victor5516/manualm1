<DIV align="left" id="T1B1CHVT"><font size="4"><b>Cylinder Head and Valve Train </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The cylinder head is made of cast aluminum alloy for better strength in hardness with lightweight, and camshaft and rocker arm shaft arranged in-line support.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The combustion chambers are formed into the manifold combustion chambers with increased squish parts for better combustion efficiency and its intake and exhaust parts are installed in the cross flow arrangement. The rocker arm operates in seesaw motion to close and open the intake and exhaust valves with camshaft by turning the rocker arm shaft of each intake and exhaust part.</div>
			
		
		<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="T1B1EB1"><font size="4"><b>Engine Block </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			<div class="T1" align="left">As the largest part of the engine components. the block has all the necessary parts attached to outer surface of it.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">On the inside surface of block, there are bore surfaces by horning, which are cylinders, and on the periphery of the cylinders, there are the passages to prevent the over-heated and to lubricate the engine block.</div>
			
		
		<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="T1B1CRANK1"><font size="4"><b>Crankshaft </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The crankshaft is to convert the rectilinear motion into the rotation motion through the connecting rod which transmits the power generated by combustion.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">On the one side of it, oil pump, crankshaft pulley and timing belt pulley are attached, and oil seal housing and flywheel are on the other side.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">A special steel of high grade cast iron is used for the material to stand the bending load and distortion. The material of the main bearing is aluminum alloy. The split thrust bearings are inserted in the journal bearing part.</div>
			
		
		<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="T1B1CR"><font size="4"><b>Connecting Rod </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The connecting rods are made of forged steel, and its section is typed "Ι" with its big end connected to crankshaft and its small end to piston pin to transmit the power.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The big end is detachable, and its upper and lower parts are fastened by bolting after the metal bearings are inserted.</div>
			
		
		<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="T1B1PPRPP"><font size="4"><b>Piston, Piston Ring and Piston Pin </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="T1B1PISTO"><font size="4"><b>Piston</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The piston is of the open skirt type and its crown is exposed in the combustion chamber to generate power. Its land and skirt parts are made of coat aluminum alloy which is light and has excellent heat conductivity in order to meet its continuous and high speed reciprocation movement.</div>
				
			
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="T1B1PR"><font size="4"><b>Piston Ring</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
				<div class="T1" align="left">It is composed of two compression rings and one oil ring and installed between the grooves of the piston to make the high speed reciprocating movement maintaining a remarkable air tightness as well as cylinders. It is a critical parts to affect the compression pressure, oil consumption, compression, blow by pressure and engine performance.</div>
				
			
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="T1B1PP"><font size="4"><b>Piston Pin</b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The pin is not fixed to the piston or connecting rod and its both ends are assembled by the circlip in the full floating type. The pin is used to transmit the power from the crown part of piston to connecting rod.</div>
				
			
		
		<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="T1B1TBP"><font size="4"><b>Timing Belt and Pulley </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			<div class="T1" align="left">The timing belt connects the camshaft timing pulley and the crankshaft timing pulley. The timing belt coordinates the crankshaft and the camshaft and keeps them synchronized. The timing belt also turns the coolant pump. The timing belt and the pulleys are toothed so that there is no slippage between them. There is a tension pulley that maintains the correct timing belt tension. The timing belt is made of a tough reinforced rubber similar to that used on the serpentine drive belt. The timing belt requires no lubrication.</div>
			
		
		<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="T1B1EM2"><font size="4"><b>Engine Mount </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			<div class="T1" align="left">This is to absorb or reduce the engine vibration and impact from the wheeled road. Engine mount is attached to the engine-front side, the engine-right side and the engine-rear side and one transaxle mount is attached to the transaxle side.</div>
			
		
		
			<P></P>
<DIV align="left" id="T1B1EGRV"><font size="4"><b>Exhaust Gas Recirculation Valve
 </b></font></DIV>
<P></P>
			
				<div class="T1" align="left">The exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system is used to
lower oxides of nitrogen (NOX) emission levels caused
by high combustion temperatures. The main element of
the system is the EGR valve which is operated electrically by the ECM.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The EGR valve feeds small amounts of exhaust gas into
the intake manifold to decrease the combustion temperature.
The amount of exhaust gas recirculated is controlled
by variations in electrical signal and exhaust back
pressure. If too much exhaust gas enters, combustion
will not take place. For this reason, very little exhaust
gas is allowed to pass through the valve, especially at
idle.</div>
				<div class="T1" align="left">The EGR valve is controlled precisely by ECM according to various operating condition of the engine.</div>
